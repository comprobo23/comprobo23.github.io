## Today

* Computer vision project showcase
* Final project team formation

## Computer vision project showcase

Throw some slides in [this Google slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Pv9qjMmhPSyqU7aIBquoI3S_g4Waf2IfNlKp8pSlqNw/edit?usp=sharing)!  Finished projects, works in-progress, and hard-fought lessons are all welcome.

## Final Project Team Formation

We want to give you a chance to form your project teams in-class today. Instead of forming projects around project topics, we are going to be suggesting you form along the following axes.

* Solidifying existing knowledge versus learning something totally new.  This class can move fast.  Some folks might want to do some spiral learning by going back and examining things that we learned before in greater detail or using some new tools.   Other folks might want to expand their breadth and push into a new eare.
* Algorithmic focus versus programming / systems focus.  By algorithmic focus we mean that your work would be mostly focused around learning a set of core algorithms. By programming / systems focus we mean that the bulk of your work would include realizing a difficult demo or application (e.g., by combining existing packages and architecting your system in a scalable / robust manner).
* Degree to which the ethical / societal implications will be centered in the project.  

First, take 10 minutes to locate yourself along these three axes and decide on one axis that is most important to you.  We'll divide up into 5 groups.

1.  Students who most importantly want a project that solidfies existing knowledge
2.  Students who most importantly want a project that explores somethign new
3.  Students who most importantly want a project with an algorithmic focus
4.  Students who most importantly want a project with a systems / programming focus
5.  Students who most importantly want a project that engages with the ethical / societal implications of the work.

In these groups, discuss why you chose to join this group and what it means for the type of project you might want to do.  If you have specific ideas for projects, you may discuss them now, but you don't have to.  If you feel like you have found a team (2-3 is a good number, but in rare circumstances 4 is okay), you are done!  If not, we'll mix it up again.

If you haven't found a team by the end of class, please fill out [this teaming survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe_6pgmwigly2WdiVK3YhfmZWzkna4UE1CvOa3nydu4qHIdNg/viewform).
