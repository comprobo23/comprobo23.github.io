The Olin College course "A Computational Introduction to Robotics" (CompRobo) serves as a tour through some of the most important ideas at the heart of modern robotics.  The course utilizes a project-based learning pedagogy that allows students to build mastery of key concepts while also allowing for a great deal of student choice and autonomy.  The major focal points of the course are mobile robotics, computer vision, and machine learning. This year we are also piloting student led discussions on societal issues and robotics.

## Conclusion and Learning More


CompRobo serves as a fun, hands-on introduction to key ideas in robotics algorithms and toolsets.  Despite the fact that the course is successful at Olin, we realize that everyone's institutional context is different.
